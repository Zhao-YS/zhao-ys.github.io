I'm Yusong Zhao(赵 昱淞), an AI researcher with a strong passion for leveraging deep learning and statistical machine learning to address real-world challenges in areas such as computer vision, bioinformatics, recommender systems, and healthcare. My recent work focuses on developing interpretable and robust AI frameworks, with an emphasis on the intersection of Bayesian statistical methods and neural generative models. I received my Master’s degree in Data Science from Columbia University, where I honed my expertise in advanced machine learning and statistical inference. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies in Bioinformatics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, one of the top-ranked universities in China. I am eager to contribute to the development of innovative AI systems that advance both theory and practice, improving lives through technology.
